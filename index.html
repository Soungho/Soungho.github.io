        <p>My name is Soungho Pahk. But call me as Jason. Now I'm studying in Nova Scotia Community College, majoring in IT Web development. Even though I don't have job experience in IT field before, I have many experience of bussiness. If you know me, you will be surprised at the experience that I have gone through.</p>
        <p>In Korea, I had worked at big department store as a buyer and run my own bussiness for 18 years. My bussiness is about education service, which means I meet a lot of customers in person. I'm confident I know about customers' taste.</p>
        <p>Not only Skills which is needed for work but also general experience are important. In addition some day your company will grow globally. Who among your employees can understand Korea better?</p>
